# VKraft
VKraft is a vowel engine I wrote for the purpose of learning vulkan. The name is definitely not inspired by a [swedish block game](https://www.minecraft.net).

## How to compile and run
Currently, there is no pre-built release of the engine, so to use it, you have to compile it from source. This project uses [cmake](https://cmake.org/) as a platform-independent way to generate build files. If you don't know how to use cmake, go [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html).
